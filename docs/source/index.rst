Napari nucleAIzer plugin documentation
======================================

**NucleAIzer** is a nuclei segmentation algorithm.

By installing our plugin into the Napari viewer, you can:

- Predict your microscopy images loaded into the Napari's stage.

- Predict multiple images using one click by selecting the input and the result folder (batch prediction).

- If you have GPU support, you can optimize our models to your data (or train new models from scratch).

Check out the :ref:`installation` for installation and the :doc:`usage` manual.
